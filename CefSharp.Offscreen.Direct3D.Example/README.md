## Offscreen Direct3D
This project is a sample of using CefSharp in an **offscreen** mode with the usage of **OnAcceleratedPaint**.

The sample creates an offscreen window and renders a simple HTML page. By running it in debug mode you can see the OnAcceleratedPaint texture being created in the application running path.
